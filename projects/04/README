To test (e.g. while in the mult dir):

1. Assemble the .asm file (to create the .hack file)
```
$ ../../../tools/Assembler.sh mult.asm
```

2. Run the CPU emulator with the test script
```
$ ../../../tools/CPUEmulator.sh Mult.tst
```

GOTCHA: make sure to re-run the assembler every time you change the .asm file!!
